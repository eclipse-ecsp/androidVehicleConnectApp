## Getting Started

Take clone of the project by using the command (git clone https://github.com/eclipse-ecsp/androidVehicleConnectApp.git) and setup the Android studio latest version.
This app demonstrate the use of vehicleConnectSDK functions.
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The Vehicle Connect App is developed in Kotlin and is compatible with Android devices running version 7.0 (API level 24) or higher.
  
### Installation

1. Download the app source code and open the application using Android studio
2. You can find the appâ€™s source code, including how it interacts with the SDK APIs. This can be reused as a reference for developing your own remote operations features.
3. Set up your own server and deploy the required APIs using appropriate server-side components. Once deployed, update the server details in the environment configuration file located at: app/src/main/assets/environment_file.json to run the application properly.
4. The Vehicle Connect SDK uses the OAuth library for its login flow. It is important to ensure that the URL scheme defined in the SDK's manifest file matches the Redirect URL specified in the application's environment_file.json file. Consistency between these values is essential for the authentication flow to function correctly.

### Coding style check configuration

Check the Coding Guideline document
[Android Coding Guidelines.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16709676/Android.Coding.Guidelines.pdf)
Use android lint for code warnings

### Deployment

You can create the APK or AAB file using android studio, and install the apk file on Android device which support Android 7.0 (API level 24) or above.
